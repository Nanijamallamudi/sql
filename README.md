1. Unnecessary Data Retrieval & I/O
SELECT * fetches all columns, even if you only need a few. For wide tables or large datasets, this results in much heavier I/O. More data needs to be read from disk and moved into memory.

2. Increased Network Traffic and Memory Usage
All columns are sent over the network, increasing latency and bandwidth use (especially noticeable when querying large tables remotely or in distributed pipelines). This puts extra load on both your database server and your application.

3. Slows Down Query Performance
Larger result sets mean more time spent processing, transmitting, and parsing data.

Queries using SELECT * can't take full advantage of covering indexes (indexes that include all the columns youâ€™re requesting), often forcing table scans instead of fast index seeks. As a result, your queries can be up to 100x slower in some cases, especially for analytical workloads common in data engineering.

4. Hinders Query Optimization and System Tuning
Specifying columns allows SQL engines to optimize execution plans and use more efficient indexes. With SELECT *, the optimizer may revert to less efficient full-table reads, increasing CPU usage and contention.

Harder to track or optimize queries in monitoring tools, since you can't instantly see which data is actually being used.

5. Maintenance and Code Stability Issues
Changes to table structure (like adding new columns) can break applications relying on column order, cause logic bugs, or inadvertently expose sensitive information.

Can introduce ambiguous or conflicting column names in joins (e.g., when joined tables have identically named columns), making query results unpredictable and harder to debug.

6. Readability and Collaboration Challenges
Explicitly listing columns makes the code self-documenting, clearer for code reviews, debugging, and onboarding new team members. SELECT * hides intent and increases the chance of mistakes or misunderstandings.

7. Potential Security and Compliance Risks
Returning all columns may expose sensitive or personally identifiable data unnecessarily, violating data minimization principles or regulatory requirements.

Best Practice for Data Engineers
Always select only the columns you actually need. This improves performance, reliability, security, and maintainability.

Use SELECT * only for quick ad-hoc querying during development, not for production code or scheduled ETL jobs.

Real-World Data Engineering Impact
In data pipelines, large intermediate tables can quickly blow up storage and network cost if using SELECT * haphazardly.

Performance bottlenecks multiply at scale; what seems negligible for small data can cripple jobs on big data systems or cloud resources.

Summary:
Using SELECT * in SQL is a common anti-pattern for data engineers. It hurts performance, increases maintainability burden, opens up for security leaks, and leads to resource inefficiency. Always prefer specifying the exact columns needed for robust, scalable data workflows.
